# Google-Keep-Clone
This app takes the react app I learn in Angela Yu web development course on Udemy and goes further. 
Orignally this app was just frontend to learn react i made some of my own tweaks to the front end and made it persitent by adding a whole backend and databse. I used a variant of the MERN stack but used postgres instead of Mongo DB

To run on you local platform:
1) clone a copy of the repo and naviagte to the project.
2)  Once there go to the frontend folder and run npm install
3)  Naviagte to the backend fodler and run npm install
4)  run npm start on the backend folder
5)  naviagte to the frontend folder
6)  run npm start

Any feedback would be grereatly appricatied :)
