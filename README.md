# Google Keep Clone

Google Keep is a note taking tool allowing users to make and delete their notes.

This app takes the react app I learnt in Angela Yu's web development course on Udemy and goes further. 
Orignally this app was just on the frontend to learn react  but I made some of my own tweaks to the front end and made it persistent by adding a whole backend and database. I used a variant of the MERN stack but used postgres instead of Mongo DB.

To run on your local platform:
1)  Clone a copy of the repo and naviagte to the project.
2)  Once there go to the frontend folder and run npm install
3)  Naviagte to the backend fodler and run npm install
4)  Run npm start on the backend folder
5)  Naviagte to the frontend folder
6)  Run npm start

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)
